# Projects in Advanced Machine Learning
Build predictive models to determine whether a given transaction will be fraudulent or not

## Project Objective
The repository contains projects I made for the course Projects in Advanced Machine Learning. I used advanced machine learning techniques to work in some key substantive areas, where such techniques have been proved to be helpful -- areas like computer vision and images, text and natural language processing, and tabular data. I also launched my models in live REST APIs and web-applications.

## Methods Used
- Machine Learning
- Deep Learning
- Convolutional Neural Networks
- Object detection models
- Recurrent Neural Networks
- Adversarial Neural Networks
- etc.

## Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn
- Keras
- etc.

## Project Description
Basically, the project includes 4 steps: 
- Load and Import Data
- Make Plots for Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data Wrangling and Feature Engineering
- Model Building
