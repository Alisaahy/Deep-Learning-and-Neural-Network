# Projects in Advanced Machine Learning
Build predictive models to determine whether a given transaction will be fraudulent or not

## Project Objective
The repository contains projects I made for the course Projects in Advanced Machine Learning. I used advanced machine learning techniques to work in some key substantive areas, where such techniques have been proved to be helpful -- areas like computer vision and images, text and natural language processing, and tabular data. I also launched my models in live REST APIs and web-applications.

## Methods Used
- Machine Learning
- Deep Learning
- Convolutional Neural Networks
- Object detection models
- Recurrent Neural Networks
- Adversarial Neural Networks
- etc.

## Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn
- Keras
- etc.

## Project Description
Basically, there're 3 projects in the repository: 

### Predicting Happiness and Write a report on U.N. World Happiness Data.
This project used U.N. World Happiness Data, to predict happiness for countries around the world. It includes the following steps:
- Use visualizations to explore bivariate results
- Describe relationships between particular features and the target variable
- Examine features that predict happiness categories using one or more models that allow for automatic feature selection
- Explain meaningful findings
- Run three prediction models to try to predict World Happiness well.
- Discuss which models performed better and point out relevant hyper-parameter values for successful models.
- Submit your best model to the leader board for the World Happiness AI Model Share competition.
