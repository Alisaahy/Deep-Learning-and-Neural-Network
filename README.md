# Projects in Advanced Machine Learning
Build predictive models to determine whether a given transaction will be fraudulent or not

## Project Objective
The repository contains projects I made for the course Projects in Advanced Machine Learning. I used advanced machine learning techniques to work in some key substantive areas, where such techniques have been proved to be helpful -- areas like computer vision and images, text and natural language processing, and tabular data. I also launched my models in live REST APIs and web-applications.

## Methods Used
- Machine Learning
- Deep Learning
- Convolutional Neural Networks
- Object detection models
- Recurrent Neural Networks
- Adversarial Neural Networks
- etc.

## Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn
- Keras
- etc.

## Project Description
There're 3 projects in the repository: 

### [Predicting Happiness and Write a report on U.N. World Happiness Data](https://github.com/Alisaahy/Projects-in-Advanced-Machine-Learning/blob/master/Assignment1/Predicting_Happiness_Mini_Hackithon_for_tabular_data.ipynb)
This project used United Nation's World Happiness Rankings country level data, to explore what makes the citizens of one country more happy than the citizens of other countries? Do variables measuing perceptions of corruption, GDP, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, or social support associate with a country's happiness ranking? I also predicted happiness for countries around the world. It includes the following steps:

- Use visualizations to explore bivariate results
- Describe relationships between particular features and the target variable
- Examine features that predict happiness categories using one or more models that allow for automatic feature selection
- Explain meaningful findings
- Run three prediction models to try to predict World Happiness well.
- Discuss which models performed better and point out relevant hyper-parameter values for successful models.
- Submit your best model to the leader board for the World Happiness AI Model Share competition.

### [Brain Tumor Diagnostic Prediction with MRI Image Data](https://github.com/Alisaahy/Projects-in-Advanced-Machine-Learning/blob/master/Assignment2/Image_Mini_hackathon_braintumor_MRIdata.ipynb)
This project used MRI image data and predicted whether a image contains tumors. It includes the following steps:

- Visualize brain tumor images that demonstrate when images have tumors and when they do not have tumors.
- Run three prediction models to try to predict brain tumor MRI images well. Use transfer learning in one of these models
- Discuss which models performed better and point out relevant hyper-parameter values for successful models.
- Submit best model to the leader board for the Brain Tumor Diagnostic AI Model Share competition.

### [BBC text classification project](https://github.com/Alisaahy/Projects-in-Advanced-Machine-Learning/blob/master/Assignment2/Image_Mini_hackathon_braintumor_MRIdata.ipynb)
This project used data includes news articles from the BBC news and built a model to classification this text dataset into multiple categories. It includes the following steps:

- Visualize the categories of the target variable and describe the dataset generally.
- Preprocess my data such that each document in the data is represented as a sequence of equal length.
- Build five models to perform text classification on the dataset. Models including: simple RNN model, Stacked RNN model, LSTM model, Bidirectional LSTM, etc.
- Discuss which model performed best and explain about how I'll try to further improve the predictive power of my model.
